## VAGARNT TOOL SETUP FOR USING VMS MANUALLY
### VAGRANT 
 A tool which manages vms lifecycle
How to use this box with Vagrant
#### Step 1
- Option 1: Create a Vagrantfile and initiate the box

        vagrant init eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9 --box-version 9.0.48 

- Option 2: Open the Vagrantfile and replace the contents with the following

        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9"
        config.vm.box_version = "9.0.48"
end

#### Step 2
        Bring up your virtual machine

        vagrant up

# VAGRANT VM PROVISIONING 

- for provisioning/bootstraping changes to be made in vagrant config file : uncomment 
        
        config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
        apt-get update
        apt-get install -y apache2
        SHEL

- do vagrant reload
- You can not provision an existing vm but --provision can be used for force provisioning


# GIT & GITHUB

> This is the standard and safe way to combine branches.

    Steps:

    ### Switch to main branch
    git checkout main

    ### Update main to latest
    git pull origin main

    ### Merge feature branch into main
    git merge feature-branch

    ### Push merged changes to GitHub
    git push origin main

# SYSTEM & TOMCAT : SERVICE MANAGEMENT
- install httpd on centos
- check the configuration using cat inside /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.servic
- There u will see three definitions --> Unit , Service, Install  --> ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd $OPTIONS -DFOREGROUND in Service is used for https status
- Now the package manager here dnf. APACHE TOMCAT can not be installed using thaT. Soooo...
- download using tar link from apache using wget and extract it
- java using dnf install java-17-openjdk -y
- Now inside the apache_folder/bin/ extarct there is startup.sh ---> script written to start tomcat
- To start tomcat do --> go inside apach --> do bin/startup.sh --> msg : tomcat staeted
- ps -ef |grep tomcat --> will get the tomacat processes
- Now we can use show ip addr to check in the browser 
- This is running because we used startup.sh, But we cannot use startup.sh Since we want tomcat to get enabled at boottime : If the OS  reboots tomcat will not start automatically so we need a scritpt for that so gonna kill that existing process of tomcaT
- Create a user --> useradd  useradd --home-dir /opt/tomcat --shell /sbin/nologin tomcat
-                                        DIR   for all bin files    for security purpose nologin

                ðŸ”¹ useradd
                The base command to add a new user to the system.

                ðŸ”¹ --home-dir /opt/tomcat
                This specifies the home directory for the new user.

                Instead of the default /home/tomcat, this user will have /opt/tomcat as its home directory.

                Useful when installing software (like Apache Tomcat) that lives in a different directory.

                ðŸ”¹ --shell /sbin/nologin
                This sets the login shell to /sbin/nologin, which means:

                The user cannot log in interactively.

                Itâ€™s used for service accountsâ€”users that exist to run software, not for real humans to log in.

                If someone tries to log in as tomcat, they'll get a message like "This account is currently not available."

                ðŸ”¹ tomcat
                This is the username you're creating.

- chown -R tomcat.tomcat /opt/tomcat/  for making tomcat user the owner
- creating the service at this path --> vim /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service

        [Unit]
        Description=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
        After=network.target

        [Service]
        User=tomcat
        WorkingDirectory=/opt/tomcat
        Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre
        Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat
        Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat
        ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
        ExecStop=/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
        Restart=on-failure





###### Description: A short description of the serviceâ€”this will show up when you use systemctl status tomcat.

###### After=network.target: Ensures that the network is up and running before Tomcat starts. This is important because web apps need network access.

###### User=tomcat: Runs the service as the tomcat user (which has no login shell, as we set earlier). This enhances security by limiting access.

###### WorkingDirectory: The base directory for Tomcatâ€”itâ€™s where it will operate.

###### Environment=...: These set environment variables that Tomcat needs:

###### JAVA_HOME: Points to the Java runtime (necessary to run Tomcat).

###### CATALINA_HOME & CATALINA_BASE: Both usually point to the same Tomcat install dir.

###### ExecStart: The script used to start Tomcat.

###### ExecStop: The script used to stop Tomcat.

###### WantedBy=multi-user.target: Tells systemd to start this service at boot time, during the multi-user stage (standard for servers and network services). Non Gui mod of operating system (Complete OS STARTUP - GUI)
